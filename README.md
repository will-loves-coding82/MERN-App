# MERN-App
An old exploration proejct on how user sign-up/sign-in works using the MERN stack. 

### Note:
The project was created as an abstraction of a trip planning app. While I never figured out
how to do that because of lack of knowledge, I did manage to understand the basics on how to use RESTful APIs 
between servers and clients. Eventually I will return to this project in the future
